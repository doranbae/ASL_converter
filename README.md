This repository is covering a part of project [**iSee iSpeak**](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2017/iseeispeak). 
iSee iSpeak is an intelligent image-based communication system for nonverbal children. Basically, it is a translator between English and a new language which we will call *Imageses*. Since there is no Imagese corpus, we decided to build our own corpus from [crowd sourcing](https://iseeispeak.herokuapp.com/home). In this image builder app, an English sentence is paired up with primary form of Imagese (based on ASL grammar rule), which this repository is covering.
